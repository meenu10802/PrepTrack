  {
    "question": "Explain SQL HAVING statement.",
    "answer": "HAVING filters aggregated data after grouping. Example: SELECT dept, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY dept HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;🧠 When to Use HAVING? You use HAVING with GROUP BY. When you want to filter grouped results based on an aggregate function (SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc.). WHERE can't be used with aggregates — that's what HAVING is for.Although HAVING is usually used with GROUP BY, SQL does allow using HAVING without a GROUP BY clause in some specific cases — but only when you're applying an aggregate function to the entire table. ✅ Example: HAVING Without GROUP BY Let's say we want to check if the total sales across all rows is greater than 1000. sql Copy Edit SELECT SUM(SaleAmount) AS TotalSales FROM Sales HAVING SUM(SaleAmount) > 1000; No GROUP BY here. HAVING is used to filter the entire result, which is just one row. It’s like applying a condition on the aggregate result. 🧠 Why Does This Work? Because the result is a single group — the whole table — SQL doesn't need to group by any specific column. So, you can use HAVING to filter that one aggregated result.❌ This won't work: sql Copy Edit SELECT SaleAmount FROM Sales HAVING SaleAmount > 100;  -- ❌ No aggregation, no GROUP BY — HAVING makes no sense here Use WHERE instead: sql Copy Edit SELECT SaleAmount FROM Sales WHERE SaleAmount > 100;  -- ✅ Correct"

It was developed in the late 1960s by the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA (now DARPA) to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.</p>
      <p><strong>How was it used?</strong><br/>
      ARPANET connected computers at different universities and research institutions. It used packet-switching technology to send data in small chunks (packets), which was more efficient and fault-tolerant than traditional circuit-switched networks. It also introduced protocols like NCP (Network Control Protocol), which was later replaced by TCP/IP — the foundation of the modern Internet.</p>
      <p><strong>When was it used?</strong><br/>
      ARPANET was developed in 1969 and was actively used through the 1970s and early 1980s. It officially shut down in 1990, but by then, its technology and concepts had already laid the foundation for the Internet as we know it today.</p>

    question: 'What is Packet Switching?',
    answer: `
      <p><strong>What is Packet Switching?</strong><br/>
      Packet switching is a method of data transmission where data is divided into smaller units called packets before being sent over a network. Each packet is sent independently and can take different routes to reach the destination, where the packets are reassembled into the original data.</p>
      <p><strong>How is it used?</strong><br/>
      Each data packet contains source and destination addresses, sequence numbers, and error-checking information. As packets travel through routers and switches, each router decides the best path for each packet. At the destination, packets are reassembled in order, even if they arrive out of sequence. This method is efficient and allows the network to handle many data transfers at the same time.</p>
      <p><strong>When is it used?</strong><br/>
      It's used in almost all modern digital communication, including the Internet. Examples include web browsing, email, video streaming, file downloads, and VoIP. Whenever you access a website or send a message, your data is sent via packet switching.</p>

  {
    question: 'What are Protocols in Networking?',
    answer: `
      <p><strong>What are Protocols in Networking?</strong><br/>
      Protocols are standard rules and formats that define how data is transmitted and received across a network. They ensure that different systems (hardware/software) can communicate properly and reliably.</p>
      <p><strong>How are they used?</strong><br/>
      Protocols define:
      <ul>
        <li>How data is structured (headers, payloads)</li>
        <li>How devices identify and connect with each other (like IP addresses)</li>
        <li>How errors are handled</li>
        <li>How data is compressed or encrypted</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><strong>Examples of common protocols:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS</strong> – for web communication</li>
        <li><strong>TCP/IP</strong> – for reliable data transmission over the Internet</li>
        <li><strong>FTP</strong> – for file transfers</li>
        <li><strong>DNS</strong> – for resolving domain names into IP addresses</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>Devices like routers, switches, and servers follow these protocols to send, receive, and process data correctly.</p>
      <p><strong>When are protocols used?</strong><br/>
      Every time you send an email, browse a website, or stream a video, multiple protocols are working behind the scenes. When two devices on a network establish a connection, they negotiate and follow agreed-upon protocols to exchange data reliably and securely.</p>
      <p><em>Bonus analogy:</em> Protocols are like the grammar rules of a language — if everyone follows the same rules, they can understand each other, even if they speak different ‘dialects’ (hardware/software).</p>
